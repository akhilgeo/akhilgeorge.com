Hi there! My name is **Akhil Abraham George**, and I'm an **SAP Consultant** at **Infosys**.

I’m part Consultant, part digital explorer, and a full-time lover of all things tech. My journey into the world of technology began with a simple curiosity for how things work, which eventually led me to pursue a degree in **Computer Science and Engineering**. Originally from the beautiful state of **Kerala, India**, I currently reside in **Kottayam**, where I balance my professional career with my passion for coding and continuous learning.

> Turning complex business challenges into elegant technical solutions. Bridging the world of SAP with the spirit of open-source innovation.

{: .note }
I believe that technology has the power to transform businesses and improve people's lives.

## My Professional Journey

Throughout my career, I've dived deep into the enterprise software ecosystem. I have gained extensive experience in:

*   **SAP Sales and Distribution (SD)**: Orchestrating complex sales processes.
*   **Vistex**: Managing pricing, rights, and royalties.

At Infosys, I tackle intricate business challenges, translating requirements into robust technical solutions. I'm constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends—whether it's the shift to S/4HANA or integrating modern cloud technologies.

## Why I Write

This blog is my digital garden. I started it as a way to document what I learn and to share that knowledge with others who might be on a similar path. Technology can be intimidating, but I hope to make it accessible through my tutorials, insights, and experiences.

From debugging obscure errors to exploring the freedom of open-source software, I write about what excites me.

## Beyond the Screen

When I'm not configuring SAP modules or writing code, you can usually find me:

*   **Tinkering**: I love exploring new software, testing different Linux distros, and playing with the latest tech gadgets.
*   **Gaming**: I enjoy analyzing game mechanics and immersing myself in virtual worlds.
*   **Exploring**: Spending quality time with family and friends, trying new foods, and traveling to new places are what keep me recharged.
