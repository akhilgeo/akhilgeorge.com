# Steps to host your site with Github

1.	Create a GitHub account or sign in to your existing one.
2.	Create a new repository by clicking on the green "New" button on the GitHub dashboard.
3.	Give your repository a name that matches your website's name, such as "username.github.io" where "username" is your GitHub username. This is important because GitHub Pages uses this naming convention to identify your website.
4.	Add your website files to your new repository. This can include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as well as any images or other assets your website requires. You can add files by dragging and dropping them into the repository on the GitHub website, or you can use the Git command line tool to push files to the repository.
5.	Create an index.html file in the root directory of your repository. This file will serve as the homepage of your website.
6.	Test your website by visiting "https://username.github.io" in your web browser, where "username" is your GitHub username. If you've set everything up correctly, you should see your website displayed in your browser.
7.	Customize your website by adding a custom domain name, changing the theme, or adding plugins or widgets as desired. To add a custom domain, you'll need to purchase a domain name from a domain registrar and configure it to point to your GitHub Pages website. You can also customize the look and feel of your website using themes, which are pre-built designs that you can apply to your site.
