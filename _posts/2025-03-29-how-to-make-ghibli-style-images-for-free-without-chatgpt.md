If you've been on social media recently, you've probably seen the latest trend: Ghiblify. The trend is transforming your photos into beautiful Studio Ghibli-inspired paintings—a Japanese animation style that's renowned for its watercolor texture, pastel color palette, and warm, cozy environments.

**The ChatGPT Ghibli Image Generation Issue**

One of the most popular ways people have been generating Ghibli-style images is through the image generation tool on ChatGPT. Although it was previously available only to premium users, OpenAI has started rolling it out to free users too. However, there is one major problem—server overload.

Several free-tier users are experiencing problems such as:

**Rate limits**: You might get a message that says, “System has reached its rate limit for image generation. Please wait for about 10 minutes before trying again.”

**Multiple retries**: Even after waiting, the system may still be too busy to generate an image.
