I have just developed a new website template for developers who are looking for a clean and simple online portfolio.
The template is free to use, simple to set up, and centered around what matters most – your work.

The template is minimal and simple, so your content is highlighted without any clutter. It is perfect for personal portfolios, developer profiles, or simple project showcases.

One of the most amazing things about this template is the automatic GitHub updates.
Your projects are automatically fetched from your GitHub repositories, so whenever you update your code, your website will be updated automatically without any additional work.

This template is perfect for developers who:

Are looking for a quick and clean portfolio

Like minimal design

Don’t want to update project lists manually

Like open-source and simple setups

You are free to use it, modify it, and customize it according to your needs.

You can check out the template, learn more details, and download it from GitHub here:
