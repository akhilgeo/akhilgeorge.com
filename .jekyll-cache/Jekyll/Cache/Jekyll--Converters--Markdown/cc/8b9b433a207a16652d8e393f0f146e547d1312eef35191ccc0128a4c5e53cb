I"$<p>Barcodes are getting replaced by QR code! In every product you buy, there is a QR code. Ever wondered how you can create a QR code yourself?</p>

<p>If you go by google, there will be many online services which will help you to create on online. But I will explain you few simple lines of python code which would get the job done.</p>

<p>The first step is installing the package using pip command.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>pip install qrcode</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to understand more on the library - Read here : <a href="https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/">https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/</a>.</p>

<p>Create a new python file (.py file) and enter the below code and Run.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import qrcode
img = qrcode.make('Qr code Text')
img.save("filename.png")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thats it, you have created a QR code with the custom text required.</p>

<p>I have created a GUI version of the same functionality using tkinter. If you want to see that code, please go to <a href="https://github.com/akhilgeo/QR-code-Builder-">https://github.com/akhilgeo/QR-code-Builder-</a></p>
