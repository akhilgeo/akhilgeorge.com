I"°<p>A heads up first - This is not like the other GodModes you have seen.  It doesnot unwind an new superpowers or secret feature.</p>

<p>One problem I usually face is to find something in control panel, even the search in the Control Panel doesnot help sometime. Godmode is a feature which could save your time in this matter.</p>

<p>GodMode is a feature you can unlock in windows, which gives you the ability to manage all the settings in a single folder. Gives you a hazzle free experience.</p>

<p><strong>How to Unlock Gode Mode in Windows?</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a New Folder in Desktop</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/images/post/Godmode_new_folder.png" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Rename the folder as below</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}</p>

<p>Once you rename, the folder icon will change to one that of Control Panel.
Double click and open the folder.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/post/Godmode.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The folder will have all the accessable commands in windows and are organised by each caterogry. You can go to each  category or make use of the search in windows explorer to find the desired command.</p>
