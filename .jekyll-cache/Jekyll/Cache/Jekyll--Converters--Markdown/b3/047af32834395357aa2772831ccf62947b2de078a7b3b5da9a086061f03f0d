I"Ö<p>One of the common challenges an SAP consultant comes across is to provide a clear vision in front of our clients of what our proposed solution can do. A significant part of that is preparation of the mockup screens, which would give an impression of an SAP ECC environment. However, the tools at our disposal for accomplishing this job are somewhat limited. Many of us traditionally use Microsoft Excel for such mockups. While Excel is a versatile tool, it certainly isnâ€™t much of an ideal for designing user interfaces, and these tend to end up being less than idealâ€”less than what we envision, and more importantly, what our clients are expecting.</p>

<h1 id="the-current-challenge">The Current Challenge#</h1>
<p>The typical approach many SAP consultants take is to draw a rough outline of a selection screen in Excel. Although this takes only a minute, it doesnâ€™t really give the finish and realism most clients would want. It also makes the consultants wait for the developers to build the basic selection screen in order to demonstrate something more representative of the end product. Delays like these affect client satisfaction and project timelines.</p>

<p>For those working with SAP Fiori, there are various UI design tools and software available, making the creation of mockups a more straightforward process. Unfortunately, similar tools for SAP ECC are few and far between. This gap often leaves consultants with no choice but to resort to less-than-ideal methods for presenting their ideas.</p>
