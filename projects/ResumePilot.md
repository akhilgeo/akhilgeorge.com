In today’s competitive job market, having a well-structured and ATS-friendly resume is essential. Many capable professionals get filtered out not because of lack of skill, but because their resumes are not optimized for automated screening systems.

To solve this problem, I built **ResumePilot** — an AI-powered resume builder designed to help users create clean, professional, and ATS-compatible resumes with ease.

## Why ResumePilot?

While working on multiple resumes and reviewing how Applicant Tracking Systems work, I noticed a recurring issue:  
Most resume tools either overcomplicate the process or lock essential features behind paywalls.

ResumePilot was built with three clear goals:
- Keep the experience simple and distraction-free  
- Ensure resumes are ATS compatible  
- Use AI meaningfully to improve content, not replace the user
